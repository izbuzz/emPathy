	    <h4>career</h4>
	    Computer science is the study of computation, information, and
	    automation. Computer science spans theoretical disciplines
	    (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to
	    applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of
	    hardware and software). Though more often considered an
	    academic discipline, computer science is closely related to computer
	    programming

	    <h3><a href="">Programming</a></h3>
	    <h4>career/hobby</h4>
	    Computer programming is the process of performing particular
	    computations (or more generally, accomplishing specific computing
	    results), usually by designing and building executable computer
	    programs. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating
	    algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption,
	    and the implementation of algorithms

	    <h3><a href="">Algorithms</a></h3>
	    <h4>career</h4>
	    Algorithmics is the systematic study of the design and analysis of
	    algorithms. It is fundamental and one of the oldest fields of
	    computer science. It includes algorithm design, the art of building
	    a procedure which can solve efficiently a specific problem or a
	    class of problem, algorithmic complexity theory...

	    <h4>career</h4>
	    Electrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with
	    the study, design, and application of equipment, devices, and
	    systems which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism.
